# Experimental Design
## Regression to mean
A statistical phenomenon showing the randomness of observations that is important when studying the effectiveness of a program or treatment.
For example, I give 100 students a test, and take the bottom 50 and retest again. If there are randomness in the score in addition to skills, then the means for the two tests are likely similary. In other words, the bottom 50 students in the first test got a lower score mean (among the 50) for the first test than the second test. In this case, if a program is performed on only on the bottom 50 students in the first test, we could not tell if the program is successful.

One of the most effective ways to remove the effect is to perform randomized control experiments, where I randomly separate the 100 students into two groups. Therefore, for each group, there are equal chances of someone who are sick, or just having bad luck. The first result between the two groups will be a baseline and will be comparable. I will select one group A to receive the program, and another B to not receive the program or receive a similar program as a placebo. After the program is done, a second will be conducted to study the difference between two groups's improvements on scores. 

Researchers can also take multiple baseline measurements when selecting people or organizations to be part of a study group. They can then select participants based on the average of their multiple measurements, not just on a single test.
