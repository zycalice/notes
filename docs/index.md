I am a data scientist/data analyst interested in applying Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning to challenge current limitations in tech, law, privacy, criminal justice and media/entertainment with a deep understanding of algorithm fairness.

I care deeply about the social good and believe that our research in technology and algorithms should benefit the public in a fair way. Therefore, I am particularly passionate in law and media domains. Check out my projects below!
