I am a data scientist/data analyst interested in applying Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning to challenge current limitations in Tech, Law, Criminal Justice, and Media/Entertainment with a deep understanding of algorithm fairness.

I care deeply about data science for social good and believe that our research in technology and algorithms should benefit the public in a fair way. Therefore, I am particularly passionate about ML/NLP applications in Tech, Law, Media/Entertainment. Check out my projects below!
