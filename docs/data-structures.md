## Notes
### Basic data structures:
- Record: A record is the data structure that stores subitems, often called fields, with a name associated with each subitem.
- Array: An array is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items, where each item is directly accessible by a positional index.
- Linked list: A linked list is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items in nodes, where each node stores data and has a pointer to the next node.
- Binary tree: A binary tree is a data structure in which each node stores data and has up to two children, known as a left child and a right child.
- Hash table: A hash table is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array.
- Heap: A max-heap is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is greater than or equal to the node's childrens' keys. A min-heap is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is less than or equal to the node's childrens' keys.
- Graph: A graph is a data structure for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges. A vertex represents an item in a graph. An edge represents a connection between two vertices in a graph.

### Algorithms:
Algorithm efficiency is most commonly measured by the algorithm runtime, and an **efficient algorithm is one whose runtime increases no more than polynomially with respect to the input size**. However, some problems exist for which an efficient algorithm is unknown.
- NP-complete: problems are a set of problems for which no known efficient algorithm exists. NP-complete problems have the following characteristics:
  - No efficient algorithm has been found to solve an NP-complete problem.
  - No one has proven that an efficient algorithm to solve an NP-complete problem is impossible.
  - If an efficient algorithm exists for one NP-complete problem, then all NP-complete problem can be solved efficiently.
