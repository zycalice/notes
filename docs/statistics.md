# Statistics
## A great resource for review:
[http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/introduction.html](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/introduction.html)

## Central Limit Theorem:
* If sample size is large enough, the sample means tends to follow normal 
  distribution.
* This is important in sampling.

## Hypothesis Testing
Type 1 and Type 2 Error:
* Type 1: False positive (alpha); null hypothesis is true but rejected
* Type 2: False negative (beta); null hypothesis is false but failed to reject

For a given alternative hypothesis testing problem, it is not possible for both 
type 1 error and type 2 error to decrease. Since false positive is more serious 
than false negative because we are rejecting the null, type 1 is more serious 
than type 2 error.  

P-Value: probability of obtaining a value of the test statistic at least as 
contradictory as the value calculated from the available sample. 

## Linear Regression Assumptions
There are four major assumptions: 1. There is a **linear relationship** between the 
dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating 
actually fits the data, 2. The **errors or residuals of the data are normally 
distributed and independent from each other**, 3. There is minimal 
multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and 4. **Homoscedasticity**. 
This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values 
of the predictor variable.

## Regression to the mean
A statistical phenomenon that explains why randomization in experiments are 
very important.
